# Libraries

Our FSE uses a variety of Love2D community-made libraries to facilitate our
progress.

These include:

* bump.lua

  Bump is an AABB (axis-align bounding box) collision detection and (limited)
  resolution library. It allows fast and simple handling of all collisions that
  occur without the performance drawbacks of a fully-fledged physics engine or
  the difficulty of a custom implementation.

* HUMP

  HUMP is a set of general purpose libraries for game development, intended to
  help developers get over the initial 'hump' of starting to make a game.
  It provides access to vector, object-orientation, game states, a
  timer/tweening, camera/viewport manipulation, and an Observer pattern
  implementation.

* lume
  
  Lume is a set of functions designed to faciliate a more functional programming
  style in Lua, with a multitude of functions relating mainly to the usage of
  tables as lists or dictionaries.

* Serpent

  Serpent is a library that serializes Lua tables. It is used to generate save
  files.

* Simple Tiled Implementation (STI)
  
  STI is a library that allows the loading and drawing of maps created with the
  Tiled map editor software, allowing us to create our levels using that editor,
  which is much easier than by hand.

* SUIT
  
  SUIT is a basic immediate-mode GUI library, allowing the easy creation and
  handling of in-game menus and interfaces.
